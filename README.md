# SaaS

These are various components discussed in [The SaaS Handbook](https://leanpub.com/saas-handbook).

The components serve as a boostrap for your SaaS project. One should start by copying and modifying
`front/`. Depending on where your SaaS development will go from there, there might be useful things
in other folders.

The programming languages used are agnostic, but generally range between Node (javascript)
+ Vue.js, Go and PHP. Generally these things are drop-in and you don't need to be an expert in all.
